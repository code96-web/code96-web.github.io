                    When I was off from work my legs strode on the hospital floor like a speed of a lightning. My sight was blurry, 
                    and my blue uniform turned into gray. My muscles were achy from standing, strolling and bending at work. Nevertheless, 
                    this is the beginning of my five days off. </br>
                    
                    I am off to California and up to South Lake Tahoe with my precious family for a mini vacation. 
                    And beyond that-I have to meet the family of my best friend. 
                    I caught myself, breathing vapidly in the parking lot. I didn’t realize I’ve been running that fast. I gently slid my stiff finger and thumb 
                    on my green bag pocket to claim the car key. The car engine started as I twist the key, but I had no patience to warm the engine up. The excitement 
                    feeling to be with my family illuminated a little sunshine on my face.
